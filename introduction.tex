\section{Introduction}
One of the goals of algebraic topology is to classify spaces up to some definition of equivalence, typically homotopy equivalence. Establishing equivalence can be tedious, as it often requires the construction of an explicit homotopy equivalence. It is typically easier to determine \textit{inequivalence}, through calculations of \defn{homotopy invariants}. These are properties of a space that are preserved by homotopy equivalences, hence if two spaces have different invariants, they cannot be homotopy equivalent. Some of the first major homotopy invariances the undergraduate student encounters are the homotopy groups $\pi_n(X),n\in \mathbb{N}\cup \{0\}$: the groups of equivalence classes of maps $f:S^{n}\rightarrow X$ with some base point. The homotopy groups carry a lot of geometric information but are notoriously difficult to compute. Even for a simple space like the $2$-sphere $S^2$, it is not obvious that there are non-trivial maps $S^3\rightarrow S^2$ (we show that such a map exists in section \ref{sec-complex-projective-space}), and it is even less obvious what the higher homotopy groups are. The groups $\pi_n(S^2)$ do not seem to follow a pattern and remain an active area of research. Only recently, in 2015, was it proven that $\pi_n(S^2)$ is not zero for all $n\geq 2$ \cite{Ivanov}.

To avoid these complications, we would like to find homotopy invariances that are easier to compute, and ideally not at the cost of too much geometric information. The homology groups $H_n(X)$ are an example of such homotopy invariants. Like the homotopy groups, they are a sequence of groups, one for each $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, but they are much simpler and easier to compute. For example, the spheres have the simple structure $$H_n(S^m)=\begin{cases}\mathbb{Z} & n=0,m\\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ 
Homology groups have some key properties that aid in calculations, most importantly a \defn{long exact sequence}, which, broadly speaking, relates the homology groups $H_nX$ to each other and to the homology groups $H_nA$ of a subspace $A\subseteq X$. Therefore, the more homology groups you know, the easier it is to calculate the rest.

Historically, homology groups were calculated from a number of geometric methods. It was Eilenberg and Steenrod who united the different homology theories by laying out a set of axioms that all homology theories satisfy \cite{Eilenberg}. In this text, we will take such an axiomatic approach, proving all results directly from the axioms. In some ways this approach best captures the essence of homology: the main task of a geometric approach to homology is to prove the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, and in practical calculations, the axioms are often preferred over the geometric construction. However, this approach is not without its disadvantages. For the results in this text to be true, we have to take as given that there exists a homology theory that satisfies the axioms, and proving this is a major undertaking worth its own project. Singular Homology is an example of a homology theory that satisfies our assumptions, as the reader is invited to confirm in \cite{Hatcher}.

Homology theory is best understood in the language of category theory and chain complexes, which sections \ref{sec-category-theory} and \ref{sec-chain-complexes} are devoted to. In section \ref{sec-axioms}, we lay out the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms and prove some immediate results for an ordinary homology theory, most importantly the homology groups of the $n$-sphere. In the following sections, we make the choice $H_0 \bullet=\mathbb{Z}$, which corresponds to Singular Homology. In sections \ref{sec-mayer-vietoris}, \ref{sec-degree-maps} and \ref{sec-cellular-homology}, we lay out three practical methods for calculating homology groups: The Mayer-Vietoris Sequence, degree maps and Cellular Homology, and use them to prove some fascinating results. In Section \ref{sec-borsuk-ulam}, we put everything together to prove the celebrated Borsuk-Ulam Theorem.
