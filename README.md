# Axiomatic Homology
This is a brief exploration of homology from an axiomatic point of view. It is the product of a 2021 Summer Vacation Scholarship project titled "Axiomatic Homology and the Borsuk-Ulam Theory." The project was supervised by Clark Barwick and funded by the University of Edinburgh School of Mathematics and College Vacation Scholarships.
